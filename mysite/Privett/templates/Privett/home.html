            <h2>Joshua Privett</h2>
            <p>As a System Administrator with a passion for building and leadership, I enjoy chasing down the most daunting of tasks. Whether it be brightening the day of a client who is visibly frustrated to begin with, solving the case that has sat in the queue for a week, or compartmentalizing the giant project into smaller tasks, I aim to constantly seek out these difficult interactions so that I may become stronger and strengthen those around me.</p>

            <h3>Tek Experts - Colorado Springs, CO</h3>
            <p><strong>Technical Lead, GCCHigh</strong><br>June 2019 – December 2020</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Initially hired to translate technical jargon into executive-facing reports for Microsoft’s Enterprise clients.</li>
                <li>Quickly promoted to Technical Engineer for Exchange Online, where I troubleshot Microsoft's Enterprise "Severity A" cases on a special team catered to their top clients. In this role, I niched into hybrid connectivity (troubleshooting connectors, HCW, certification expiration, disconnected archives, etc)</li>
                <li>Soon thereafter, I was promoted to Technical Lead for GCCHigh. I trained my team of about 30, and then lead them to quickly become top performers across the entirety of the organization. I accomplished this by creating a comprehensive escalation process and workflow for my team, and I also separated them into niche fields of expertise so we could cover all technical areas proficiently and in a short amount of time. In this role, I still managed to specialize in Exchange cases, and I was even able to create troubleshooting guides for Microsoft’s internal document repository. This means that if you open a Microsoft ticket in Enterprise Exchange or M365 environments, you have a chance of encountering someone I personally trained, or a chance that your technician is using documentation that I wrote to solve your ticket.</li>
